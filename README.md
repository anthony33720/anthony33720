Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Anthony Raynaud!

I'm a full-stack developer with a strong foundation in back-end development, digital transformation, and system implementation. Originally from France, I'm now based in Sweden, fluent in English and French, with good proficiency in Swedish. Iâ€™m passionate about scalable solutions and problem-solving in tech, and my journey has led me to work on diverse projects, from bar consulting to backend development.

ðŸ“– What Iâ€™m Working On

I'm currently diving deeper into Java and Spring Boot while also expanding my front-end skills in React and TypeScript. When I'm not coding, I manage my own bar consulting company, where I handle everything from client relationships to project execution.
